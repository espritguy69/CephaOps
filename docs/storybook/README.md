\# Storybook – UI/UX Specification



This directory defines the \*\*entire user-facing behaviour\*\* of CephasOps.



Start with:



1\. `STORYBOOK.md` – full operational flows  

2\. `PAGES.md` – screen-by-screen breakdown  

3\. `WIREFRAMES.md` – wireframes for frontend implementation  

4\. `USER\_FLOWS.md` – end-to-end journeys for each actor (Admin, Scheduler, SI, Finance)

5\. `MULTI\_COMPANY\_STORYBOOK.md` – vertical company (Menorah, Kingsman, etc..)


These files are the source of truth for:



\- Frontend feature design

\- API requirements

\- Multi-company UI logic
